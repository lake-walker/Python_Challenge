I created a skript that is meant to analyze financial records for a company
I'm given the month and the profit/loss from that month
1. the skript find the total number of months that are included in the data set
2. it gathers the net amount of profit or loss of the company over the time period
3. then it creates a new list that contains all the values of the difference in profit/loss between two consecutive months
4. prints and displays the average of that difference in profit/loss
5. next it will find the greatest increase and decrease in profits and the corresponding months
6. finally, it exports the results of the analysis to a text file

In this task I was required to create a skript that would analyze election results
The large data file contains a voter id number, registered voting county, and the chosen candidate
The skript produces the winner of the election
1. it first calculates the total number of votes in the election
2. it then calculates the total number of votes for each candidate and their percentage of the total votes
3. then itdisplays the winner of the election as the individual with more than 50% of the vote
4. lastly, it exports the results to a text file
